## Security Measures

### Dependency Management

- All dependencies are automatically scanned using:
  - npm audit (daily)
  - Dependabot (GitHub)
  - Snyk (integration available)

- Dependencies are kept up-to-date with automated PRs

### Code Scanning

- **CodeQL**: Automated code scanning for security vulnerabilities
- **Semgrep**: Static analysis security testing (SAST)
- **ESLint**: Code quality and security rules
- **TypeScript**: Type safety to prevent common errors

### Supply Chain Security

- **SBOM Generation**: CycloneDX SBOM generated for each release
- **Provenance**: NPM package published with provenance statements
- **License Compliance**: Automated license checking for all dependencies
- **OpenSSF Scorecard**: Security health metrics tracking

### Data Security

- **No sensitive data storage**: Server does not store user credentials
- **Read-only operations**: Database queries are parameterized to prevent SQL injection
- **Input validation**: All user inputs validated using JSON schemas
- **Audit logging**: Ingestion operations logged for compliance

### Secure Development

- **Code Review**: All changes require review before merge
- **Git Hooks**: Pre-commit hooks enforce linting, formatting, and tests
- **Branch Protection**: Main branch protected with required checks
- **Signed Commits**: Recommended for contributors

## Compliance

This project follows security best practices from:

- **OWASP**: Top 10 security risks
- **NIST**: Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF)
